    <p>Our business question was:

        1. How to improve our profits 					
        2. What products should we focus on (Which Market and category, ie machine)
        3. Which products should we drop (That are not profitability)
        4. To predict future economic conditions, trends, or values


        # 1 - Using Excel to clean an uncleaned dataset.

        We got the dataset of an e-commerce store. As you can see below, it is uncleaned data with categorical and continuous values.

        # 2 - Creating a data dictionary.

        The recipe for creating a Data Dictionary is as follows:
        - Numbers Treatment
        - Date Treatment
        - IRSRS approach with VLOOKUP()

        Such preparation will be useful for Data Modelling and Applications of algorithm.

        # 3 - Data Preparation - Statistical Validation and Analysis

        In this chapter, we learnt about two most common categories of measurements:
        - Measures of Central Tendency
            • Mean
            • Mode
            • Median
        - Measures of Dispersion
            • Range
            • Variance
            • Standard Deviation
            • Coefficient of Variation

        # 4 - Correlation Investigation

        What is Correlation?

        • Correlation summarizes a relationship between variables.
        • Correlation coefficient is the statistics that shows the strength of the relationship
        • Correlations are useful because they can indicate a predictive relationship that can be used in practice.

        ![jpg](Correlation%20Matrix.jpg)

        We can see that Profit per Unit is correlated to Profit and Unit Cost is correlated to Sales.


        # 5 - Trendline Regression

        Regression analysis is used to estimate the strength and the direction of the relationship between two linearly related variables: X and Y. 
        X is the “ independent ” variable and Y is the “ dependent ” variable.

        ![jpg](Profit%20vs%20Sales%20Trendline.jpg)

        Based on the above trendline analysis, we can assume that for every 1 unit of X, Y will increase by 1.735.
        If X = 0, the intial value of Y will be $208.75.


        # 6 - Test of Significance for Individual Parameters

        What is P Value?

        The P Value is the probability that the assumptions from the status quo (null hypothesis) is true by default.
        The probability of observing sample data at least as extreme as the actually obtained test statistic.

        Small p values provide evidence against the null hypothesis.

        The smaller (closer to 0) the p value, the stronger is the evidence against the null hypothesis.

        Here, we reject Quantity and Delivery Lag Time as both P-Values are above 0.05.
        ![P-Value](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108440564/177555658-8ef176b2-3c8b-485a-8a9d-13d1c91b92c1.jpg)

        # 7 - Multiple Linear Regression

        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108440564/177556763-4eed3a03-f627-4537-a61b-9d94b161514b.png)

        Based on our dataset for the E-Commerce store, we can say that there is a 92% accuracy whilst using MLR.

        The formula would be:

        y = 2.727ppu + 0.237s - 0.99cpu</p>
