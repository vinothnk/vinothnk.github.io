## Python

### Udemy - 100 Days of Coding by Angela Yu

An ongoing process in my journey to learning Python. Even though I had learnt python during my course in SUTD, working full time whilst studying part time did not allow me to fully concentrate on the lessons, with family commitments on the side as well as Covid. Hence, I decided to restart learning python to ensure I understand the basic principles of python. 

Below is the link of the repository of my 100 days of coding progress.

### Foundation of Data Science

As this is the introduction to Data Science, I learnt the following steps in the data cycle and how to perform data analysis using Excel.

- Step 1: Business Question
- Step 2: Data Acquisition
- Step 3: Data Preparation
- Step 4: Data Modelling
- Step 5: Data Visualisation
- Step 6: Business Decision

We will be covering Steps 1 till Step 4 in this module.

### Data Visualisation

In my class for Data Visualisation, we were taught to use visualisation tools like Tableau and PowerBI.

For my group project, we decide to do a visualisation on the effects of Covid throughout the world.

### Data Wrangling with Programming

For my next module, we learnt to use Python to perform the following actions :
- data discovery
- data structuring
- data cleaning
- data validation
- data enrichment
- data aggregation

Our group project has 2 parts. 

The first was to clean a dataset which was structured. Meaning that data was either in table format or from a csv/excel file format
which would make it easier to clean.

The second is to clean UNSTRUCTURED data. Examples of such data are Text files, Email, social media, media, mobile data, etc.


***E-Commerce dataset - Structured***

We found the dataset on Kaggle. It was Pakistan's largest e-commerce data. We used this dataset as 1 of the requirement for our project was that
dataset consisted of 100k to 10million rows minimum. This dataset had about 500k rows which fulfilled our project requirements.

***Enron Emails - Un-Structured***

For our un-structured dataset, we decided to go with emails. The reason why we decided to go with emails was because we wanted to perform sentiment analysis using the 
***NLTK*** package. And we had the requirement of minimum 1k to 100k rows to fulfill. 

After doing our research, we found the Enron emails dataset with around 500k emails. That should be sufficient to clean, structure and to analyse the data for sentiment analysis.
