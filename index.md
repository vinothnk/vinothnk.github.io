## Python

### Udemy - 100 Days of Coding by Angela Yu

An ongoing process in my journey to learning Python. Even though I had learnt python during my course in SUTD, working full time whilst studying part time did not allow me to fully concentrate on the lessons, with family commitments on the side as well as Covid. Hence, I decided to restart learning python to ensure I understand the basic principles of python. 

Below is the link of the repository of my 100 days of coding progress.

### Foundation of Data Science

As this is the introduction to Data Science, I learnt the following steps in the data cycle and how to perform data analysis using Excel.

- Step 1: Business Question
- Step 2: Data Acquisition
- Step 3: Data Preparation
- Step 4: Data Modelling
- Step 5: Data Visualisation
- Step 6: Business Decision

We will be covering Steps 1 till Step 4 in this module.
